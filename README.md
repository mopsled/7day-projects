7day-projects
=============

A collection of projects created in a week.

Why?
----

I rarely finish projects. That's because I usually have conflicting motives:

  - I started the project to learn a language, and I'm satisfied I know enough Clojure/CoffeeScript/node.js/Ruby/Go after before I accomplish anything significant
  - I strive for perfection in some way (design or testing or API) but take it to a level where I feel trapped by any choice I make
  - I fail to scope a project to a reasonable size and never ship anything

The purpose of this repository is to rekinder the spirit of creativity by limiting projects to be simple enough to complete in a week. There's still room to try to achieve the lofty goals of previous projects, but in a constrained way, such that I can still produce something at the end.

There's going to be some ugly babies in these projects, but that's part of the point. With an emphasis on shipping and constraint, I was to see what's possible a week at a time.
